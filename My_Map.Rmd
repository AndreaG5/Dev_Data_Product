## My_Map
Here is presented a map constructed with leaflet, which highlights my trips of 2018.



```{r, message=F}
library(leaflet)
latit = c(39.0000, 43.3615, 45.2838)
long = c(-9.759, 1.2637, 09.1053)
cities = c("Lisbon", "Toulouse", "Milan")
df = data.frame(lat = latit, lng = long, cit = cities)
df %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(popup = cities)
```
